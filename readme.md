# 6 - PROCESSING & NEUROSKY

This is a sketch to connect your neurosky EEG sensor to Processing.

To make this work, you'll need to download the tool [thinkgearconnector](http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc). This enables the communication between the two and will return the result in JSON. 

You will also have to add the [Thinkgear-Java-Socket](https://github.com/borg/ThinkGear-Java-socket) library to Processing.
