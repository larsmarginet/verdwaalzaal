# 5 - PROCESSING & ARDUINO - MADMAPPER

This is a simple sketch to test making a screen recording of the Processing canvas.

The saveFrame() method creates a PNG of the current frame, so at the end you get a png-sequence from all the frames. 

On line 14 of the sketch the port is set to /dev/tty.usbmodem142101, but it might be a different one for you, so be sure to set it to the right one.
