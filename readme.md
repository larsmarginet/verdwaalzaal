# 12 - PROCESSING & PIXELSORTING

This is an experimental visual made with videos, perlin noise and audio. We got inspired by the term generative impressionism and created these visuals. 

This sketch uses [Spout](https://spout.zeal.co/) to send the frames to MadMapper for project mapping.

To make this work, you'll need to download the tool [thinkgearconnector](http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc). This enables the communication between the two and will return the result in JSON.

You will also have to add the [Thinkgear-Java-Socket](https://github.com/borg/ThinkGear-Java-socket) library to Processing.
