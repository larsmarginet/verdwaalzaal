# 3 - P5 - PERLIN NOISE

This is a first experimental visual made with perlin noise, based on the algorithm developed by [wangyasai](https://wangyasai.github.io/Perlin-Noise/) with the Memento color scheme. 

The serial communication to the browser happens over websockets with a tool called [P5.serialcontrol](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialport).

On line 2 of the sketch the port is set to /dev/tty.usbmodem142101, but it might be a different one for you, so be sure to set it to the right one.
